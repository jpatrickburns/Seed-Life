<h1>Welcome to Seed Life Skills</h1>
<img src="images/chopping.jpg" alt="" class=" right frameRight"  id="dude" >
<p>Seed Life Skills is a research-based, living curriculum grown from the vision of food education advocate, dedicated father and Chef Hugh Acheson.</p>

<p>We are a collaborative effort between culinary, university, and industry professionals, school administrators, parents, teachers, movers and makers dedicated to preparing our next generation of dreamers, doers, and leaders.</p>

<p>We are a proud member of the Alliance for Family and Consumer Sciences (FCS). FCS is the profession previously known as “Home Economics.” Learn more about us at <a href="http://www.aafcs.org" target="_blank">www.aafcs.org</a>.</p>

<h1 style="clear:none">Our mission</h1>
<p>Seed Life Skills is a living curriculum dedicated to empowering youth to be sustainable stewards of food and financial resources; while emphasizing innovative and handcrafted approaches to core and community lessons.​
</p>

<p>We get kids cooking, connecting science to real life problems, and engineering sustainable solutions. We provide curriculum tools to support innovative, lab-based learning in the classroom and equipment that is desperately needed by teachers who often pay out of pocket to supply these experiences for students. By providing these essential tools, together we are laying the foundation of a thriving economy and empowering the next generation of entrepreneurs, educators, and community leaders to be prepared for whatever life can throw their way.</p>
